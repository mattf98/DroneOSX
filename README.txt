***IMPORTANT*** This jar is intended for a school project.  It currently has no real functionality other than a simple login screen that leads to another GUI.  If you've happened to stumble upon this, then you've waisted hard drive space. But hey, at least you've seen this.


VERSIONS:

* 0.0.1 (Current Version) - Added login screen.  Very primitive, only for basic concept.  Once logged in(only one username and password that are hardcoded), will open another GUI for main screen.
